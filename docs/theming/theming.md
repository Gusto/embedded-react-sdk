## Theming

Theming provides a simple and powerful way to customize the visual appearance of the Gusto Embedded React SDK UI components. This feature allows you to change colors, typography, shadows, and other design variables to globally update the SDK visuals to match your application.

> Theming is the recommended approach for customizing your UI. It provides the best balance of customization power and maintenance simplicity. For advanced customization, consider using [component adapters](../component-adapter/component-adapter).
