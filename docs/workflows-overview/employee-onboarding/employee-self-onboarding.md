## Overview

In the case an employer elects to allow the employee to self-onboard, they can be provided with the self-onboarding workflow. This workflow places the responsibility of submitting some required information on the employee.

### Implementation

```jsx
import { Employee } from '@gusto/embedded-react-sdk'

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <Employee.SelfOnboardingFlow
      companyId="a007e1ab-3595-43c2-ab4b-af7a5af2e365"
      employeeId="4b3f930f-82cd-48a8-b797-798686e12e5e"
      onEvent={() => {}}
    />
  )
}
```

#### Props

| Name                | Type   | Description                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| employeeId Required | string | The associated employee identifier.                             |
| companyId Required  | string | The associated company identifier.                              |
| onEvent Required    |        | See events table for each subcomponent to see available events. |

## Using Self-Onboarding Subcomponents

Like Employee onboarding, self-onboarding components can be used to compose your own workflow, or be rendered in isolation. Many of these components are the same as the ones used for general employee onboarding, however some fields are hidden and shown based on the current user type. For guidance on creating a custom workflow, see [docs on composition](a086lb248al).

### Employee.Landing

Displays guidance on what to expect from the workflow and what information the employee will be required to have on hand and provide.

```jsx jsx
import { Employee } from '@gusto/embedded-react-sdk'

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <Employee.Landing
      companyId="a007e1ab-3595-43c2-ab4b-af7a5af2e365"
      employeeId="4b3f930f-82cd-48a8-b797-798686e12e5e"
      onEvent={() => {}}
    />
  )
}
```

| ------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| employeeId Required | string | The associated employee identifier.                             |

### Employee.Profile

_See component documentation in the Employee Onboarding section for a complete list of props and events since this component is used in both employee onboarding and employee self onboarding._

When used in self onboarding, used to collect basic information about the employee:

- First and last name
- Email address
- Social security number
- Date of birth
- And home address

For self onboarding, you need to be sure to set the `employeeId` property. The `isAdmin` property should be left out or set to false (which is the setting by default). The following example has the Profile component configured for self onboarding:

```jsx
import { Employee } from '@gusto/embedded-react-sdk'

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <Employee.Profile
      companyId="a007e1ab-3595-43c2-ab4b-af7a5af2e365"
      employeeId="4b3f930f-82cd-48a8-b797-798686e12e5e"
      onEvent={() => {}}
    />
  )
}
```

### Employee.FederalTaxes

_See component documentation in the Employee Onboarding section for a complete list of props and events since this component is used in both employee onboarding and employee self onboarding._

Provides required form inputs for employee federal tax configuration.

```jsx
import { Employee } from '@gusto/embedded-react-sdk'

  )
}
```

### Employee.StateTaxes

_See component documentation in the Employee Onboarding section for a complete list of props and events since this component is used in both employee onboarding and employee self onboarding._

Provides required form inputs for employee state tax configuration.

```jsx
import { Employee } from '@gusto/embedded-react-sdk'

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Employee.StateTaxes employeeId="4b3f930f-82cd-48a8-b797-798686e12e5e" onEvent={() => {}} />

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Employee.PaymentMethod employeeId="4b3f930f-82cd-48a8-b797-798686e12e5e" onEvent={() => {}} />
  )
}
```

### Employee Document Signer
