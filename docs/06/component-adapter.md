## Component Adapter

The Component Adapter system provides a powerful way to customize the UI components used throughout the Gusto Embedded React SDK. This feature allows you to replace the default React Aria-based components with your own custom implementations while maintaining compatibility with the SDK's functionality.

The Component Adapter provides a "bring your own UI" approach, enabling seamless integration with your existing design system while maintaining all the business logic and functionality of the SDK.
