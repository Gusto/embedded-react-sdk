# @gusto/embedded-react-sdk - Internal README

To install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Local development

### For components

If you just need to develop a component outside of its context within a workflow, you can use Storybook:

```
npm run storybook
```

### For workflows

If you need to test your component within the larger context of a workflow, you'll need to setup Zenpayroll + GWS-Flows.

- Follow setup instructions for [Zenpayroll](https://github.com/Gusto/zenpayroll) and start local dev server
  - In another tab run the following commands in Zenpayroll directory(these generate necessary partner account for `gws-flows`) :
  ```
  bundle exec rails runner "DevAccountCreator.new.create_dev_accounts"
  rake partners_api:dev_setup_for_gws_onboarding
  ```
- Follow setup instructions in the readme for [GWS Flows](https://github.com/Gusto/gws-flows)
- in SDK, Run `npm run dev:setup`; if that fails, follow the instructions below to setup manually:
  - Run `npm link ../gws-flows/node_modules/react` in sdk folder - this is needed to avoid duplicate react instances in local development due to using [npm/yarn link](https://legacy.reactjs.org/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning.html)
  - In GWS-Flows project folder, run `yarn link -r ../embedded-react-sdk`
- In SDK, run `npm run dev`

Now your local changes appear in GWS Flows.

To see the SDK running in GWS Flows, visit it [locally](http://localhost:7777/demos?react_sdk=true) and choose `React SDK (New company)` or `React SDK (Company Onboarded)` under `Select a Type` and click `Create Demo`

Components and Flows will be shown at the top of the page in a `nav`. Company Components will automatically appear as they are added.

## How to leverage Translations

Translations are stored in [/src/i18n](/src/i18n).

The are broken out by locale (e.g. `en`), then by namespace, which is usually the name of the component they are used in. The source of truth is the `en` locale - the rest will be autogenerated by translation service.

After writing the new translations, run `npm run interface` to generate the types.

In your components, first use `useI18n` hook, which takes in component namespace and loads appropriate resource file into dictionary. After that use the `useTranslation` hook to access the translations in that component and any child components.

### Translation Key Guidelines

Follow these conventions when creating or modifying translation keys:

#### Naming Convention

**Use camelCase for all translation key names:**

```json
{
  "pageTitle": "Federal Tax Information",
  "federalEinLabel": "Federal EIN",
  "federalEinDescription": "Your company's Federal Employer Identification Number",
  "continueCta": "Continue"
}
```

#### Standard Suffixes

Use consistent suffixes to indicate the purpose of each key:

- **`Cta`** - Call-to-action buttons (e.g., `submitCta`, `continueCta`, `cancelCta`)
- **`Label`** - Form field labels (e.g., `firstNameLabel`, `emailLabel`)
- **`Description`** - Help text or descriptions (e.g., `federalEinDescription`)
- **`Title`** - Page or section headings (e.g., `pageTitle`, `sectionTitle`)
- **`Placeholder`** - Input placeholders (e.g., `emailPlaceholder`)
- **`Error`** - Error messages (e.g., `requiredFieldError`, `invalidEmailError`)

#### Grouping Related Keys

Group related keys using nested objects for better organization:

```json
{
  "validations": {
    "firstName": "First name is required",
    "lastName": "Last name is required",
    "email": "Email address is required and must be valid",
    "address": {
      "street1": "Street address is required",
      "city": "City is required",
      "state": "State is required"
    }
  },
  "labels": {
    "openMenu": "Open menu",
    "menuLabel": "Menu"
  },
  "alerts": {
    "progressSaved": "Your progress has been saved",
    "errorEncountered": "There was a problem with your submission"
  }
}
```

Common grouping patterns:

- **`validations`** - Form validation error messages
- **`labels`** - Accessibility labels and field labels
- **`alerts`** - Alert and notification messages
- **`icons`** - Icon accessibility labels
- **`table`** - Table-related labels (column headers, actions)

#### When to Use snake_case

**Only use snake_case when required by external contracts:**

1. **API Enum Values** - When keys match backend API responses:

```json
{
  "onboardingStatus": {
    "admin_onboarding_incomplete": "Admin-onboarding Incomplete",
    "self_onboarding_invited": "Self-onboarding: Invited"
  }
}
```

2. **i18next Pluralization** - Required by i18next for plural forms:

```json
{
  "priority_one": "{{count}}st",
  "priority_two": "{{count}}nd",
  "priority_few": "{{count}}rd",
  "priority_other": "{{count}}th"
}
```

3. **Programmatic Identifiers** - When used as flow/step identifiers that match API:

```json
{
  "stepTitles": {
    "add_addresses": "Add company addresses",
    "federal_tax_setup": "Company federal tax information"
  }
}
```

#### Examples

**Good:**

```json
{
  "pageTitle": "Employee Profile",
  "continueCta": "Continue",
  "cancelCta": "Cancel",
  "validations": {
    "firstName": "First name is required",
    "emailFormat": "Email must be valid format"
  },
  "labels": {
    "personalInfo": "Personal Information"
  }
}
```

**Avoid:**

```json
{
  "page_title": "Employee Profile", // ❌ Don't use snake_case
  "ContinueCTA": "Continue", // ❌ Don't capitalize suffix
  "validation_first_name": "First name...", // ❌ Don't use snake_case
  "first_name_validation": "First name...", // ❌ Poor grouping
  "lbl_personal_info": "Personal Info" // ❌ Don't abbreviate
}
```

## Creating components

### Block components

Block components are focused, reusable components that serve specific functionality. They follow these patterns:

- **Single Purpose**: Each component should generally handle a specific task (e.g., list, form, etc.)
- **Base Component**: Uses [BaseComponent](./src/components/Base/Base.tsx) for consistent behavior and error handling
- **Compound Pattern**: Exposes subcomponents (Head, List, Actions) for flexibility and composition

#### Examples

- [DocumentList](./src/components/Company/DocumentSigner/DocumentList/DocumentList.tsx)
- [LocationForm](./src/components/Company/Locations/LocationForm/LocationForm.tsx)

### Flow components

Flow components compose block components and other flow components together using state machines to manage transitions. They follow these patterns:

- **State Management**: Uses the [Flow](./src/components/Flow/Flow.tsx) component with a state machine to handle transitions
- **Component Composition**: Can compose both block components (e.g., list → form) and other flow components
- **Naming**: Suffix with "Flow" (e.g., `DocumentSigner`, `Locations`)

For example, `EmployeeOnboardingFlow` composes both block components (profile, taxes) and other flow components (document signer) to create a complete onboarding experience.

#### Examples

- [DocumentSigner](./src/components/Company/DocumentSigner/DocumentSigner.tsx)
- [Locations](./src/components/Company/Locations/Locations.tsx)
- [EmployeeSelfOnboardingFlow](./src/components/Flow/EmployeeSelfOnboardingFlow/EmployeeSelfOnboardingFlow.tsx)

## Testing locally

You can run the test suite locally with the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```
