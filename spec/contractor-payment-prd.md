# Product Requirements Document: Contractor Payment Flow

## Executive Summary

The Contractor Payment Flow enables companies to efficiently pay their contractors through an
automated, secure system that supports multiple payment methods and provides comprehensive tracking
and reporting. This product addresses the critical business need for streamlined contractor payments
while maintaining compliance and providing visibility into payment operations.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

- **Manual Payment Processing**: Companies struggle with manual, time-consuming contractor payment
  processes

- **Compliance & Documentation**: Difficulty maintaining proper records and receipts for contractor
  payments
- **Time-Sensitive Processing**: Need to meet payment deadlines while ensuring proper approval
  workflows
